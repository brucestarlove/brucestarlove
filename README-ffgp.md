I created this website to convey the information of this campaign clearly and display the petition signatures.

Shifted it from [old google site](https://sites.google.com/view/fortgreeneparkrenovation) to [Nextjs app](https://www.friendsoffortgreenepark.org/petition-signatures) with integrated petition signatures!

The point is this: NYC Parks claims to have community support for the plan, but nearly every single person we talk to in the park about this proposal reacts negatively. We agree with most of the plan, it's just the few points we've detailed that we strongly oppose. The users of the park want to keep the trees and do not want the concrete plazaâ€”which will create a heat island effect, increase noise & visual pollution from the streets, and destroy the original design including the Bye mounds.

Check out the information on the website and let us know what you think! We aren't trying to be obstructionists for its own sake. We want sensibility, peace, representation and wiser use of funds.
