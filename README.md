# ✨ hello and good tidings 🌊

**Looking for full-time hybrid employment with a company that values initiative, creativity, growth and excellent user experience**

I'm a tech tinker, systems thinker, and creative technologist who has experimented a lot and now wants to join an existing company to grow and co-create bigger things. I still have much to learn, and desire to make greater impact expeditiously. I blend broad technical understanding with deep obsession, emotional intelligence, and a lifelong passion for understanding & solving problems.

My background spans enterprise consulting, developer education, community organizing, and creative tech. I've led nonprofit web revamps, built community platforms from scratch, co-founded & managed student organizations (including my university's first hackathon, RAMHacks, 2014-2016), hosted dozens of webinars and interviews, and organized interdisciplinary symposia.

I've recently been advising an early-stage startup and supporting small-org clients, while further developing my technical skills and prototyping several ambitious apps. I took a long sabbatical during the COVID-19 pandemic for health and exploration, while helping some small organizatons at-cost.
